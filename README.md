In prokaryotes, the evolutionary and environmental factors behind the large variation in genome size is not entirely clear. One common hypothesis is that thermophiles and hyperthermophiles have smaller genomes due to selection for efficient replication or genome stability under such extreme conditions. This project aimed to build upon previous observations by investigating how genomic features relate to optimal growth temperatures (OGT) across the archaeal domain – and whether these patterns are conserved or lineage-specific.
